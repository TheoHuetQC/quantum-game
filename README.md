# **Quantum Museum** üèõÔ∏è‚ú®  

## **About the Project**  
**Quantum Museum** is an **educational puzzle game** built with **Python and Pygame**, designed to introduce players to the fundamental principles of **quantum mechanics** through interactive challenges.  

In this game, players explore a **museum** where scientists have successfully given **quantum properties** to macroscopic objects. The first level introduces the concept of **superposition** and **wavefunction collapse** through a simple yet engaging puzzle.  

## **Current Features**  
- **Top-down view** of the museum.  
- **Interactive dialogues** explaining quantum mechanics concepts.  
- **A quantum stone** that exists in multiple positions simultaneously.  
- **Measurement mechanics**: clicking on the stone "measures" it, collapsing its superposition to a single position.  
- **Basic inventory system** (to be expanded in future updates).  

## **Work in Progress üöß**  
This project is still **in development**, and several improvements are planned:  
‚úÖ **Better graphics & animations** for a more immersive experience.  
‚úÖ **More levels & puzzles** covering other quantum mechanics concepts (entanglement, tunneling, etc.).  
‚úÖ **Enhanced user interface** with better visual effects and smoother interactions.  

## **How to Play**  
1. Start the game and follow the narrator's dialogues.  
2. Observe the quantum stone appearing in multiple locations.  
3. Click on the stone to measure its position and resolve its superposition.  
4. Once the path is clear, click on the door to proceed to the next room.  

## **Requirements**  
- Python 3.x  
- Pygame library (`pip install pygame`)  

## **How to Run the Game**  
1. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```  
2. Run the game and Enjoy ! :  
   ```bash
   level1.py
   ```
